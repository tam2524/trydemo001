### Using Vue and Tailwind via CDN

Use the CDN to try Vue and Tailwind right in the browser without any build step. The CDN is designed for
development purposes only, and is not the best choice for production.

### Tailwind
```
 <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
```

### Vue Global
```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.global.js"></script>
```
